This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting flight delays using GPU-accelerated libraries (RAPIDS, cuML, XGBoost). The model achieves *82.90%* accuracy in predicting whether a flight will be delayed.

## Dataset

The analysis uses a dataset of 3 million flight records (flights_sample_3m.csv) containing various attributes:
- Flight dates, airlines, and flight numbers
- Origin and destination airports
- Scheduled and actual departure/arrival times
- Flight distance and elapsed time
- Delay information categorized by cause

### Data Overview
- 3,000,000 flight records
- 32 columns (9 categorical, 4 integer, 19 float features)
- Target variable: Flight delays (defined as arrival delay > 15 minutes)
- Class distribution: ~17.18% delayed flights

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory analysis revealed:
1. *Distribution of delays*: Most flights arrive on time or early, with a right-skewed distribution of delays
2. *Airline performance*: Significant variation in average delays across airlines (best performer has negative average delay)
3. *Distance vs delays*: No strong linear relationship between flight distance and delay time

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Handling missing values with mean/mode imputation
- Feature engineering:
  - Extracting time features (day of week, month, year, departure hour)
  - Airport importance features (major origin/destination)
  - Distance categorization
  - Airline encoding
- Data conversion to GPU format using RAPIDS (cuDF)

## Models Compared

Two models were trained and compared:
1. *Random Forest Classifier*
   - Accuracy: 82.86%
   - Training time: 13.73 seconds
   - Prediction time: 19.48 seconds

2. *XGBoost Classifier*
   - Accuracy: 82.90%
   - Training time: 18.53 seconds
   - Prediction time: 2.15 seconds

XGBoost was selected as the final model due to its slightly higher accuracy and significantly faster prediction time.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: numpy, pandas, joblib, xgboost, cudf, cuml (for GPU acceleration)

### Making Predictions
Use the provided prediction.py script:

bash
python prediction.py --input your_data.csv --output predictions.csv --model XGBoost_model.joblib


### Arguments
- --input: Path to the input CSV file (required)
- --output: Path to save predictions (required)
- --model: Path to the model file (defaults to 'XGBoost_model.joblib')

## Files in Repository

- flight_delay_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with complete analysis and model building
- XGBoost_model.joblib: Serialized XGBoost model
- prediction.py: Script for making predictions with the trained model
- README.md: Project documentation

## Performance Summary

The model achieves good performance with a balanced approach to identifying delayed flights:
- Overall accuracy: 82.90%
- Fast prediction time (2.15 seconds for 600,000 test samples)
- Successfully handles class imbalance (only ~17% of flights are delayed)

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:
1. More extensive feature engineering (airport congestion, weather data integration)
2. Hyperparameter optimization
3. Ensemble methods combining multiple models
4. Testing additional algorithms (Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting variants)
5. Deployment as a web service for real-time predictions
